GraceShopper - BottledUp

This is an example of an online store designed for our company, BottledUp, to sell our eco-friendly bottles, lids, and straws. The goal is to allow customers to sign up to our site as users, shop, pay for, and submit orders, and get their products. In addition, guests who are not logged in should be able to shop as well. Shopping carts should exist for each user, and should persist beyond a single session and across devices.

Authors: Jen, Rachel, Stephanie, Jane and our Grace Hopper fellows/instructors
